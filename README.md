OcramTower
==========

Web based game meant to be a spiritual successor to SimTower and Yoot Tower

This game currently has no gameplay or functionality besides displaying a tower that has already been made.
Future revisions will allow the player to build a tower from the ground up and use the top canvas to see a smaller,
more manageable viewing field.

The main page is OcramTower-prealpha1.html and it might take a while to load. I recommend you open it in a private tab
or in Internet Explorer 10+.

An improved page is OcramTower-prealpha2.html, it has more of the images loaded in memory though it makes very little usage of the
occupied rooms. The top 40~ floors are still incomplete as of June 17, 2014 but the whole tower will look logical and pretty soon.
